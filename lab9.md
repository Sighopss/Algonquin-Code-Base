Key assumptions:
- **VM Sizing**: Web front-end uses D2s v5 (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, Linux); API back-end and payment use D4s v5 (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, Linux); ML uses NC6s_v3 (6 vCPU, 112 GB RAM, 1x V100 GPU, intermittent usage at 200 hours/month).
- **Database Scaling**: SQL Hyperscale (8 vCores for 5 TB); Cosmos DB (10,000 RU/s for 10 TB); Synapse Analytics Dedicated SQL Pool (DW1500c for 15 TB).
- **Traffic/Usage**: CDN at 10 TB/month per region (30 TB total); data transfer for migration: 30 TB outbound.
- **Hours/Month**: 730 for continuous resources.
- **Free Tiers**: Applied where applicable (e.g., first 100 GB outbound free; DMS Standard tier free).
- Prices exclude taxes/VAT and potential discounts unless specified.

Total estimated **migration cost**: $4,457 (one-time).  
Total estimated **monthly operational cost (PAYG)**: $28,892.  
Total estimated **monthly management cost**: $300.  
Annual operational run rate (PAYG): ~$346,704.

## Cost Optimization Strategy
To achieve cost-effectiveness, it is recommended a mix of Azure-native features and commitments. Current PAYG baseline: $29,192/month ($350,304/year). Optimizations can yield 40-60% savings.

### 1. Reserved Instances (RI) vs. PAYG Comparison
RIs offer up to 72% savings for 1-3 year commitments (no upfront for monthly payments).

| Resource Group             | PAYG Monthly | 1-Year RI (30% Savings) | 3-Year RI (60% Savings) | Annual Savings (3-Year) |
|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| VMs (Web + API + Payment) | $5,606      | $3,924                 | $2,242                 | $39,792                |
| Databases (All)           | $22,581     | $15,807                | $9,032                 | $162,588               |
| **Total Impact**          | **$28,187** | **$19,731**            | **$11,274**            | **$202,380**           |

- **Recommendation**: Commit to 3-year RIs for steady workloads (e.g., databases, web VMs) for ~60% savings ($17,000/month reduction). Use Spot VMs for ML batch jobs (up to 90% off).

### 2. Other Savings Opportunities
- **AutoShutdown & Right Sizing**: schedule non-peak shutdowns (e.g., ML VMs) and use Azure Advisor for resizing; estimated 15% savings ($4,300/month).
- **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: If using existing Windows licenses, save up to 40% on Windows VMs (not applied here; Linux assumedâ€”reassess for $500+/month savings).
- **Tagging & Cost Allocation**: Implement tags for resource groups (e.g., by region/app) to track usage; enables budgets/alerts for 5-10% waste reduction.
- **Serverless Shift**: Migrate batch jobs to Azure Functions ($0.20/million executions) vs. VMs; potential $1,000/month savings on ML.
- **Free Tiers/Discounts**: Leverage 400 RU/s + 25 GB Cosmos free tier ($50/month savings); multi-year commitments for CDN (10% off).

**Net Optimized Monthly Cost**: $14,000 (50% reduction via RI + scaling).

## Future Growth and Budget Plan (3-Year Projection)
Assuming 20% annual growth in users/traffic (e.g., +20% VMs, +2 TB storage/year), baseline PAYG escalates without optimizations. We project optimized costs incorporating annual reviews.

| Year | Projected Growth Factor | PAYG Annual Cost | Optimized Annual Cost (w/ RI + 10% Efficiency Gains/Year) | Key Adjustments |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **1 (2026)** | 1.0x (Baseline) | $350,304 | $201,600 (42% savings) | Initial RI commitments; auto-scaling implementation. |
| **2 (2027)** | 1.2x | $420,365 | $221,760 (47% savings) | Migrate ML to serverless; right-size databases via Advisor. |
| **3 (2028)** | 1.44x | $504,438 | $244,000 (52% savings) | Upgrade to newer VM series (e.g., Dsv6 for 20% better price/perf); explore Azure Savings Plans. |
| **Total (3 Years)** | - | **$1,275,107** | **$667,360** | Cumulative savings: $607,747. |

### Strategic Recommendations for Futur
- **Annual Audits**: Use Azure Cost Management for quarterly forecasts; set 10% buffer for growth
- **Scalability Features**: Adopt Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for microservices (potential 25% savings vs. VMs)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Monitor for 15% YoY inflation in pricing; hedge with 3-year RIs
- **ROI Projection**: Break-even on migration within 6 months; 3-year TCO savings of 50% vs. on-premises
