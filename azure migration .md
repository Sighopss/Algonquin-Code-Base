## <a id="_bdc6hv5f1k0p"></a>__Case Study: Swiss Re__

Swiss Re, a global reinsurance giant in the insurance and banking world, moved their SAP S/4HANA environment to Azure to modernize their IT\. The goal? Boost efficiency and keep their operations rock\-solid in a fast\-moving industry\.

## <a id="_pucmuf8lamha"></a>__Why Migrate to the Cloud?__

Swiss Re wanted to shake things up with their IT setup\. Their main drivers were:

- __Cost savings__: Ditching expensive on\-premises servers for Azure’s scalable resources to save big\.
- __Automation__: Cutting down manual work to reduce errors and free up their team for bigger tasks\.
- __Disaster recovery__: A one\-click solution to keep business running through cyberattacks or natural disasters\.
- __Agility__: Modernizing their infrastructure to stay flexible and support global operations\.

In short, they wanted IT that’s lean, mean, and ready for anything\.

## <a id="_7vaut469rsvs"></a>__Questions to Dig Into Their Infrastructure__

To make this migration smooth, I’d need to understand their current setup\. Here’s what I’d ask:

- What’s your on\-premises infrastructure? Server specs, OS versions, network layout?
- What apps or databases tie into SAP S/4HANA, and how do they depend on each other?
- How much data are you handling, and what are your storage and compliance needs \(e\.g\., GDPR, financial regs\)?
- What’s your current backup, disaster recovery, and security setup?
- Any pain points with performance, scalability, or maintenance?
- Got any custom SAP tweaks or third\-party tools we need to account for?

## <a id="_naxu1wn60dtd"></a>__Migration Approach__

I’d recommend a __re\-platforming__ approach \(aka “lift, tinker, and shift”\)\. This means moving SAP S/4HANA to Azure Virtual Machines with minimal changes at first, then optimizing with cloud\-native tools like Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery and Azure DevOps for automation\. It’s a great balance: quick enough to get to the cloud fast, but leaves room to modernize later\. Azure Migrate will help assess their setup, and this approach keeps everything compliant for their regulated industry\.

## <a id="_uucpf8jj8xsd"></a>__High\-Level Schedule__

Here’s a rough timeline, assuming no major hiccups:

- __Weeks 1\-4: Assessment__ – Use Azure Migrate to map out the current setup and spot risks or dependencies\.
- __Weeks 5\-8: Planning__ – Design the Azure architecture, finalize RACI, and prep a pilot test\.
- __Weeks 9\-12: Migration__ – Move data and apps in phases, starting with non\-critical workloads; set up automation and DR\.
- __Weeks 13\-16: Testing & Optimization__ – Test thoroughly, tune performance, and train users\.
- __Week 17: Go\-Live__ – Switch to Azure fully, with 4 weeks of close monitoring to ensure stability\.

__Total time__: ~4\-5 months\.

## <a id="_aelwv2urhqwv"></a>__What Drove Swiss Re’s Decision?__

Running a reinsurance giant like Swiss Re isn’t just about tech it’s about keeping things running smoothly without burning cash or tripping over regulations\. They wanted to cut the crazy costs of on\-premises servers and scale up or down as business demands shift\. Reliability was huge; in their world, downtime could cost millions, so a one\-click disaster recovery system was a lifesaver\. Automation meant their team could focus on innovation instead of repetitive tasks\. And compliance? Non\-negotiable\. Azure’s security and compliance features made it easy to stay audit\-ready\. Ultimately, they wanted IT that felt like a superpower, not a chore, to thrive in a wild, unpredictable industry\.
